An opinionated JS framework that wires your JavaScript execution to your HTML templates by creating pseudo closures of execution and scoping. Allowing you to manage, in a more consistant way, your events `binding/unbind` and your DOM scope manipulation.

By splitting your logic into small specialized responsible actions, Stik.js will help you avoid both the gigantism and namespace hell on your JavaScripts.
